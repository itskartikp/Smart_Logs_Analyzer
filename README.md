# FRONTEND


This is the frontend part of our project. Follow the steps below to set up and run the React application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): Make sure to install a version that includes npm (Node Package Manager).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine:


Navigate to the project directory:


Install project dependencies using npm:

```
npm install
```


Install axios and react-dropzone:

```
npm install axios react-dropzone
```

This will install the necessary packages for making HTTP requests (axios) and handling file uploads (react-dropzone).


Start the React development server:

```
npm start
```
This will launch the application and open it in your default web browser. By default, it will be available at http://localhost:3000.
